Beowulf Clustering is formed with regular computers, sharing paralleling process among them, thus are scalable performance cluster wich can be ussed as data mining, data processing, internet server. In each of these computer are installed a open software linux distribuiton arranged into a dedicate lan area network, coneccted with a mesh swicht with fastethernet . While Beowulf are used to develop parallel programming it has to be monitored to maintain efficient infrastructure and troubleshooting in cluster system. Thus, monitoring is fundamental not only to software operations but to optimize system. The implementation of monitoring dashboard and configuration of software streaming tool require the identification of the network parameters, wich is done using linuxs networking mapping open tools. Thus a remote SSH client ussing settings, like tunneling and port fowarding can manage cluster. This work is motivated by monitoring real-time metrics of memory usage, cpu thermal, fan speed, networking bandwidth, disk write rate, remotely from outside of localhost network. display those actions in a same monitoring and by troubleshooting directives thus dashboard can be used for watching entire systems, maintaining health and performance of systems services and applications.
